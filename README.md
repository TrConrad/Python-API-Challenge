This challenge was an excerise is utilizing Python and Pandas to pull and manipulate data from an API. We were tasked to pull a randomly generated list of cities and their respective weather conditions from API throught the use API-keys and JSON in a jupyter notebook .ipynb file. The data in question came from the OpenWeatherAPI, which was then sorted into dataframes. From there, multiple scatter plots were made to analyze both the data, as well as trends within the data, such as correlation and linear regression. The list of cities and their various weather conditions were then converted into a csv file, which was read into a seperate .ipynb file, where it was cross referenced against the Geoapify API so that it could be plotted on a global map. The data was then filtered down by ideal vacation weather conditions, and then plotted on a new map.
